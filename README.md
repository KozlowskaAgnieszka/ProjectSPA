### Work is in progress on my latest project: a **Single Page Application with React**! 

My aim? To let you easily select check-in and check-out dates and book your dream room, all while indulging in some spa treatments and keeping track of your order summary.
Next up, we will create a user account and authentication system, so you can access all the goodies with ease. 

And what's the tech stack? **React, React Router, and Redux**, plus a  **Lodash, Date-fns, and Vite**.
